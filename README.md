Limecoinx Core 0.11.1 supports a full implementation of InstantX, Darksend improvements
and a new version of enforcement compatible with the newer Bitcoin architechure.

- Fully implemented IX
- Added support for DSTX messages, as a result DS should be much faster
- Clear vValue in SelectCoinsMinConf - should fix an issue with conflicted txes
- "Debug window" -> "Tools window" renaming
- "Last Darksend message" text added in overview page
- Many new languages are supported, such as German, Vietnamese, Spanish
- Fixed required maturity of coins before sending
- New masternode payments enforcement implementation
- Added support to ignore IX confirmations when needed
- Added --instantxdepth, which will show X confirmations when a transaction lock is present
- fix coin control crash https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/5700
- always get only confirmed coins by AvailableCoins for every DS relative action
- New languages supported Portuguese, German, Russian, Polish, Spanish, Vietnamese, French,
Italian, Catalan, Chinese, Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Czech, Turkish and Bavarian (and many more)
- Full implementation of spork. Currently this includes 4 different sporks, InstantX, InstantX block enforcement, masternode payments enforcement, and reconverge. This uses the inventory system, so it's super efficient and very powerful for future development. Reconverge will put the blockchain into a mode where it will attempt to reprocess any forks without restarting the client, this means if we even had a fork in the future this can be triggered to fix it without any damage to the network.
- Masternode payments now uses the inventory system, which will result in much lower bandwidth usage
- Improved caching
- use wallet db ds flag in rpc
- update tx types in UI / fix tx decomposition / use wallet db ds flag
- use wallet db to save ds flag / debug
- use AvailableCoinsType instead of string in walletmodel
- New inventory system for IX messaging, providing super fast/low bandwidth IX communication


What is Limecoinx?
----------------

Limecoinx is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant
payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Limecoinx uses peer-to-peer technology
to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money
are carried out collectively by the network. Limecoinx Core is the name of open
source software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Limecoinx Core software, see http://www.limx.eu



Building process
-----------------

**compiling Limecoinx from git**

Use the autogen script to prepare the build environment.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

**precompiled binaries**

Precompiled binaries are available at github, see
https://github.com/limecoinxproject/limecoinx-binaries

Always verify the signatures and checksums.


Development tips and tricks
---------------------------

**compiling for debugging**

Run configure with the --enable-debug option, then make. Or run configure with
CXXFLAGS="-g -ggdb -O0" or whatever debug flags you need.

**debug.log**

If the code is behaving strangely, take a look in the debug.log file in the data directory;
error and debugging message are written there.

The -debug=... command-line option controls debugging; running with just -debug will turn
on all categories (and give you a very large debug.log file).

The Qt code routes qDebug() output to debug.log under category "qt": run with -debug=qt
to see it.

**testnet and regtest modes**

Run with the -testnet option to run with "play limecoinxs" on the test network, if you
are testing multi-machine code that needs to operate across the internet.

If you are testing something that can run on one machine, run with the -regtest option.
In regression test mode blocks can be created on-demand; see qa/rpc-tests/ for tests
that run in -regtest mode.

**DEBUG_LOCKORDER**

Limecoinx Core is a multithreaded application, and deadlocks or other multithreading bugs
can be very difficult to track down. Compiling with -DDEBUG_LOCKORDER (configure
CXXFLAGS="-DDEBUG_LOCKORDER -g") inserts run-time checks to keep track of what locks
are held, and adds warning to the debug.log file if inconsistencies are detected.
